To install `fnm` (Fast Node Manager) on WSL2, follow these steps:

1. **Open WSL2**: Start your WSL2 terminal

2. **Install fnm**: You can install `fnm` using a script provided by the maintainers. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -sSfL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
   ```

3. **Add fnm to Your Shell**: After the installation, you need to add `fnm` to your shell profile. If you're using `bash`, add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.fnm/node-versions/node/v$(fnm current)/bin:$PATH"
   eval "$(fnm env)"
   ```

   If you're using `zsh`, add it to your `~/.zshrc` instead.

4. **Reload Your Shell**: To apply the changes, reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Or for `zsh`:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. **Verify the Installation**: Check if `fnm` is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   fnm --version
   ```

6. **Install Node.js**: Now you can install Node.js versions using `fnm`. For example, to install the latest LTS version:

   ```bash
   fnm install --lts
   ```

7. **Use a Specific Version**: To set a specific version of Node.js, you can use:

   ```bash
   fnm use <version>
   ```

You should now have `fnm` installed and ready to manage your Node.js versions on WSL2.
