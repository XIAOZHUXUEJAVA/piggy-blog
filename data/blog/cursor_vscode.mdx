summary: Cursor VSCode Conflict
---

Cursor is a recently popular AI editor. Before this, I was using the VS Code editor. However, after I downloaded Cursor, I encountered a conflict between the `code` command in VS Code and Cursor as the following:

When I use `code .` command in PowerShell, the editor that opens is Cursor instead of VS Code.

**How to fix it:**

- Find `code` and `cursor` command files

PowerShell (replace Username with your Username ):

```bash
 Get-Command code
```

- Backup `code.cmd` and `code`

```bash
 Copy-Item "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\cursor\resources\app\bin\code.cmd" "C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\cursor\resources\app\bin\code.cmd.bak"

  Copy-Item "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\cursor\resources\app\bin\code" "C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\cursor\resources\app\bin\code.bak"
```

- Delete `code.cmd` and `code`

```bash
Remove-Item "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\cursor\resources\app\bin\code.cmd"
Remove-Item "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\cursor\resources\app\bin\code"
```

- And then we can use `code` to open VS Code
